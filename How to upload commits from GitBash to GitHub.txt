How to push "upload" a commit from computer to Git Hub.

First you have to clone (download) your repo to your computer by "git clone "Repo URL"

1. git init to initilalize the git (just a hidden folder.) and downloads other things you have in that repo (like a Read me file)

2. git remote add origin (to be able to push from comp to git hub) 
	git remote add origin "url link" (basically cloning)

3. git remote -v is basically to see if we are able to pull or push. It should say origin "url" (fetch) and under it the same thing except (push)
	it says we have permission to push or pull.

4. git add . just uploads all the files in the repo folder from the computer. you can do an individual file by git add "file"
	this tells the comp thats its ready to commit

5. git commit -m "the purpose of the commit- ex (Adding a new Read me File)"

6. git push origin main is just to upload the commit to GitHub.
